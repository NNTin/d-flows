  "_comment": "Test fixture for duplicate tag error in release workflow. Tests the workflow's validation that prevents creating a release for an existing version. This tests duplicate tag detection in the release workflow, which is the second line of defense after bump-version.yml validation. Git state required: Existing tag v1.0.0 already exists, main branch checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should FAIL at tag existence check with error message: 'Tag v1.0.0 already exists', should not create GitHub release, should not update major tag. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario DuplicateReleaseTag' before testing.",
