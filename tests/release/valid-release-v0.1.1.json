  "_comment": "Test fixture for a valid v0.1.1 patch release (v0 patch bump). Tests the release workflow's ability to create a patch release during the v0 development phase. Git state required: No existing tag v0.1.1, existing tag v0.1.0, main branch checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should validate version format, create GitHub release with tag v0.1.1, update major tag v0 to point to v0.1.1, generate release notes. Used in the rollback-failed-release test scenario to validate manual release triggering when the automatic release trigger fails. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario ValidReleaseV0Patch' before testing.",
