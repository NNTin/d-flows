  "_comment": "Test fixture for patch bump on a release branch. Tests maintaining an older major version while newer versions exist on main. This scenario is documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Patching an Older Major Version'. Git state required: Existing tag v1.2.0 on release/v1 branch, existing tag v2.0.0 on main branch (newer major version exists), release/v1 branch checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should calculate new version as v1.2.1, validate major version matches branch (v1), trigger release workflow. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario ReleaseBranchPatch' before testing.",
