  "_comment": "Test fixture for nonexistent branch error. Tests the workflow's validation that the target branch exists. This tests branch existence validation as documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Troubleshooting - Issue 2'. Git state required: Branch 'release/v5' does NOT exist, main branch exists with some tags. Expected outcome: Workflow should FAIL at branch validation step with error message: 'Branch release/v5 does not exist in the repository', should not proceed to version calculation. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario NonexistentBranch' before testing.",
