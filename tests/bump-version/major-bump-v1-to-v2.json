This scenario is documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Releasing a New Major Version'. Git state required: Existing tag v1.2.0 on main branch, main branch checked out, no release/v1 branch exists yet. Expected outcome: Workflow should calculate new version as v2.0.0, should automatically create release/v1 branch from v1.2.0 commit, trigger release workflow. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario MajorBumpV1ToV2' before testing.",
