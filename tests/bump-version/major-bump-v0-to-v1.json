  "_comment": "Test fixture for major version bump from v0 to v1 (promotion to stable). Tests the transition from development (v0.x.x) to stable (v1.0.0). This scenario is documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Promoting to v1.0.0'. Git state required: Existing tag v0.2.1 on main branch, main branch checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should calculate new version as v1.0.0, should NOT create release/v0 branch (v0 doesn't need maintenance), trigger release workflow. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario MajorBumpV0ToV1' before testing.",
