  "_comment": "Test fixture for invalid branch format error. Tests the workflow's validation of branch naming conventions. Only 'main' or 'release/vX' patterns are allowed. Git state required: Branch named 'feature/test-branch' exists, some existing tag (e.g., v0.1.0) on main. Expected outcome: Workflow should FAIL at branch validation step with error message: 'Invalid branch format. Use main or release/vX', should not proceed to version calculation. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario InvalidBranch' before testing.",
