  "_comment": "Test fixture for first release scenario on main branch. Tests the workflow's ability to create the initial version (v0.1.0) when no tags exist. This scenario is documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Creating the First Release'. Git state required: No existing tags, clean main branch with at least one commit. Expected outcome: Workflow should calculate version as v0.1.0, trigger release workflow, validate that first release is on main branch. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario FirstRelease' before testing.",
