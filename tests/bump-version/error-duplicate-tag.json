  "_comment": "Test fixture for the duplicate tag error scenario. Tests the workflow's validation that prevents creating a version that already exists. This is an error case testing duplicate tag detection as documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Troubleshooting - Issue 1'. Git state required: Existing tags v0.1.0 AND v0.1.1 on main branch, main branch checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should calculate new version as v0.1.1, should FAIL at validation step with 'Tag v0.1.1 already exists' error, should not trigger release workflow. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario DuplicateTag' before testing.",
