  "_comment": "Test fixture for the error when attempting first release on a release branch. Tests the workflow's validation that first releases must be on main. This tests the first release validation rule as documented in VERSIONING.md under 'Troubleshooting - Issue 4'. Git state required: No existing tags anywhere in the repository, release/v1 branch exists and is checked out. Expected outcome: Workflow should detect this is a first release (no tags), should FAIL with error: 'First releases must start from main branch, not from release branches', should not proceed to release creation. Setup: Run 'setup-test-git-state.ps1 -Scenario FirstReleaseError' before testing.",
